Tools
#### Hardware
- [Webcams](https://a.co/eXKSBEV)
	Recommended to use an iPhone X at minimum for best tracking, however webcam tracking on PC have improved significantly in recent time so it's a viable option for those who don't own an Apple device.
- [Microphones](https://a.co/7hsKqy8)
	Please note that XLR microphones will require an Audio Interface and oftentimes a Pre-Amp as well. If you can't get an audio interface, a USB microphone would be what you should buy.
